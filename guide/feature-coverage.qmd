title: Feature parity with ggplot2
---

## Missing

* geom_text:
  - no manual hjust argument
  - no fontweight, fontstyle mappings (fontweight is fontface in ggplot; TODO upgrade and check)
  - aes hjust, vjust don't accept numbers (only strings like center, top, etc..)
* geom_path no linewidth option (uses size)
* Shape names not supported (see aes spec)
* `None` for do nothing not always supported
  - shape aesthetic
* Not all linetypes supported (and must be name)
  - ggplot's dotdash is dashdot
* geom_sf: would be geom_carto in plotnine. Handles crs conversions for you.

## Differences

```python
from plotnine import *
from plotnine.data import huron
ggplot(huron, aes("year", "level")) + geom_line(linetype=(0, (1, 5)),)
```

## Key syntax differences

* replace `.` with `_`
* funs and fun_y, etc..?
* `where` clause
* use quotes are mappings

## Mapping differences

* sans-serif vs sans, monospace vs mono
